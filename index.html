            About
        </div>

        
        
    <h>
        Hello, my name is <h class="bold">Mai Vo</h>, a fourth-year <h class="bold">computer engineering</h> major at 
        <h class="bold">Georgia Tech</h>. I've interned at NASA Goddard, Lockheed Martin, and The Aerospace Corporation.
    
        Some of my interests include working with embedded systems - I enjoy designing hardware components as well as
        integrating hardware with software. I used to be a Computer Science major and switched because doing too much software was too much, and now I've
        found that working only with hardware is also too much for me. Thus, I want to work with a combination of both
        software and hardware.

        <br><br>

        You might wonder why am I majoring in computer engineering and working at all these space companies? I've wanted to
        contribute to space exploration ever since I was in highschool. Space has always fascinated me because there's so much we 
        don't know about - I want to help discover what's out there.
            
        <br><br>
        
        A little bit about me: I'm an optimist and am always cheerful in any situation.
        
        
        Some of my interests include playing the guitar, reading, working out, and spending time with family and friends.
        <br><br>
        Before COVID-19, I studied abroad in France and travelled all over Europe. Here are some of my photos!

        <h>
            This past summer and in Fall 2019, I interned with <h class="bold">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</h> with the Avionics and Electrical Ground
            Support Equipment Group as a Pathways Intern working on the Roman Space Telescope. I developed software and hardware to test the 
            deployment system on the RST.

            <br><br>

            In Summer 2019, I interned with <h class="bold">Lockheed Martin</h>'s Rotary and Missions Systems Division MASC-F 
            group as a UI/UX intern and participated in the Mission Concept Academy as Deputy Project Manager with <h class="bold">NASA's L'SPACE</h> program, 
            working with other students to propose a mission concept and write a preliminary design review. You can view our team website 
            and PDR <a href="https://teamceleastial.github.io" target="_blank">here!</a>
            <br><br>
            I have work experience with <h class="bold">The Aerospace Corporation</h>, working on a proprietary visualization engine and other projects as a Software Engineering Intern.
            I've optimized applications with regards to UI/UX on these projects.
            <br><br>
            Outside of school and work, I'm constantly a part of the
            <h class="bold">Yellow Jacket Space Program</h>'s Avionics Team creating
            circuit boards and writing software to interface with a microcontroller. 
            
            Our team goal is to send a liquid engine rocket into space. 
            <br><br>
            I also perform research as co-lead of the Avionics with <h class="bold">Space Systems Design Lab</h> at Georgia Tech
            with Dr. Glenn Lightsey, working on GT-2, a 1U cubesat.
            
            I've also worked on designing a database for our Mission Control Center and various projects for
            STRATOS, a high altitude balloon project.
            <br><br>
            Click <a href="ece1100project.html" target="_blank">here</a> to view a project I worked on for an introductory ECE class - I created 
            the schematic and layout for a PCB as well as soldering all the components onto the board.
            <br><br>
            Some of my <h class="bold">skills</h> include harnessing, soldering, circuit design, leadership, and communication.
            I'm also extremely motivated in my work and am capable of learning any technologies that are thrown my way.

            Goals
        </div>

        <h>
            Long-term goals:

            <br><br>

            I have plenty of long-term goals. A lot of it contains my future career goals, but also a lot of it doesn't contain career. 
            My philosophy on life is not to have a good work-life balance, but to also have my work become a part of my life. I believe that
            one should only work doing something they love, and that's exactly what I intend on doing.
            <br><br>

            My current goal is to finish undergrad and go out into the workforce and work for 2-3 years to pay off my undergrad debt
            , gaining technical knowledge and skills. 
            I would then want to go back to school and obtain 
            my master's degree in engineering. However, I'm also interested in getting an MBA, so I would love to attend a program that has a joint masters 
            of engineering and business administration degree. By the time I go back for my masters, I would have paid off my undergrad tuition and should have
             saved up enough for the masters degree.
            <br><br>

            I've also considered studying abroad for my masters, since after studying abroad in France for a semester, I've learned to love living in a 
            different country and learning their culture and customs.
            <br><br>

            I believe in having fun throughout life, while doing work that becomes a part of my life. Help me reach my goals.
