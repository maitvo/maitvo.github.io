        <h class=ab>Hello! My name is Mai Vo, a third-year computer science major at 
            Georgia Tech, concentrating in Devices and Systems Architecture.
        <br>
        Some of my interests include working with embedded systems and I enjoy designing hardware components as well as
            integrating hardware with software.
        
        <br>
        I love space! I would like to work in the space and defense industry and contribute to space exploration. Thus, I would like to work with
            space technology.
            
        <br><br>
        
        A little bit about me: I'm an optimist and am always cheerful in any situation.

        <h>
            This summer, I'm interning with Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Missile Systems Division and am participating in the Mission Concept Academy with NASA's L'SPACE program,
            <br>
            working with other students to propose a mission concept.
            <br><br>
            I have work experience with <h class="bold">The Aerospace Corporation</h>, working on a proprietary visualization engine and other projects as a Visualization Intern.
            <br>
            I've optimized applications with regards to UI/UX on these projects.
            <br><br>
            Outside of school and work, I'm constantly a part of the
            <h class="bold">Yellow Jacket Space Program</h>'s Avionics Team creating
            circuit boards 
            <br> and writing software to interface with a microcontroller. 
            
            Our team goal is to send
            a liquid engine rocket into space. 
            <br><br>
            I also perform research with <h class="bold">Space Systems Design Lab</h> at Georgia Tech
            with Dr. Glenn Lightsey.
            <br>
            I've worked on designing a database for Mission Operations and various projects for
            STRATOS, a high altitude balloon project.
            <br><br>
            I'm extremely motivated in my work and I always aspire to perform
            my best. 
            <br>
            I'm capable of learning any technologies I find interesting
            or that are thrown my way.
