        <h>
            Hello, my name is <h class="bold">Mai Vo</h>, a fourth-year <h class="bold">computer engineering</h> major at 
            <h class="bold">Georgia Tech</h>. Fun fact: I recently switched my major to CompE from computer science.
        
            Some of my interests include working with embedded systems and I enjoy designing hardware components as well as
            integrating hardware with software.
        
        
            I would like to work in the space and defense industry and contribute to space exploration. Thus, I would like to work with
            space technology.
            
        <br><br>
        
        A little bit about me: I'm an optimist and am always cheerful in any situation.
        
        
        Some of my interests is playing the guitar, reading, working out, and spending time with the fam.
        <br><br>
        Before COVID-19, I studied abroad in France and travelled all over Europe. Here are some of my photos!

        <h>
            This past summer and in Fall 2019, I interned with <h class="bold">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</h> with the Avionics and Electrical Ground
            Support Equipment Group as a Pathways Intern working on the Roman Space Telescope. I developed software and hardware to test the 
            deployment system on the RST.

            <br><br>

            In Summer 2019, I interned with <h class="bold">Lockheed Martin</h>'s Rotary and Missions Systems Division MASC-F 
            group as a UI/UX intern and participated in the Mission Concept Academy as Deputy Project Manager with <h class="bold">NASA's L'SPACE</h> program, 
            working with other students to propose a mission concept and write a preliminary design review. You can view our team website and PDR <a href="https://teamceleastial.github.io" target="_blank">here!</a>
            <br><br>
            I have work experience with <h class="bold">The Aerospace Corporation</h>, working on a proprietary visualization engine and other projects as a Software Engineering Intern.
            I've optimized applications with regards to UI/UX on these projects.
            <br><br>
            Outside of school and work, I'm constantly a part of the
            <h class="bold">Yellow Jacket Space Program</h>'s Avionics Team creating
            circuit boards and writing software to interface with a microcontroller. 
            
            Our team goal is to send a liquid engine rocket into space. 
            <br><br>
            I also perform research as co-lead of the Avionics with <h class="bold">Space Systems Design Lab</h> at Georgia Tech
            with Dr. Glenn Lightsey, working on GT-2, a 1U cubesat.
            
            I've also worked on designing a database for our Mission Control Center and various projects for
            STRATOS, a high altitude balloon project.
            <br><br>
            I'm extremely motivated in my work and I always aspire to perform
            my best. 
            <br>
            I'm capable of learning any technologies I find interesting
            or that are thrown my way.
