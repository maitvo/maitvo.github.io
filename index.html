            <h class=ab>Hello! My name is Mai Vo, a computer science major at 
                Georgia Tech, concentrating in Devices and Systems Architecture.
            <br>
            I'm interested in working with embedded systems and I enjoy designing hardware components as well as
                integrating hardware with software.
            
            <br>
            I love space! I would like to work in the space and defense industry and contribute to space exploration. Thus, I would like to work with
                space technology.
                
            <br>
            
            I have experience working in the field with The
                Aerospace Corporation, Lockheed Martin, the Yellow Jacket Space Program, and Space Systems Design Laboratory.
            
            <br>
            Some of my interests is playing the guitar, reading, working out, and spending time with the fam.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before COVID-19, I studied abroad in France and travelled all over Europe. Here are some of my photos!
