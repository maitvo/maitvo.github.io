            For my ECE 1100 project, I decided to learn how to better use Kicad and create my own PCB
            from scratch. I've done projects where I help write the schematic, or a I help do the layout 
            or placement of components. I've never built a PCB from the ground up, so I wanted to be able to do just that for 
            this project. 
            <br><br>
            First, I knew I wanted to put the design in a certain format and to do that, 
            I needed to put a bunch of LEDs on the board. Before making the schematic, I made a diagram of the design 
            with all the LEDs placed where I wanted and labeled them numerically.

            Here's the schematic:

            This schematic showcases 37 LEDs, paired with 13 resistors. It uses two coin batteries and uses 
            a switch to turn the circuit on and off.

            <br><br>
            Here's the layout:

            <br><br>
            I've placed the LEDs and resistors in a way that accomodates the design I wanted. In turn, I then had to 
            route all the connections. KiCad automatically shows you where you should route, so I routed it accordingly
            and in a way that's easy for it to fit on the board and looks good.
            <br><br>
            After the PCB was finished and all laid out, I sent it to JLCPCB to print so I could place all the components on it and 
            have the LEDs light up.
            <br><br>
            Here's a picture of the printed bare PCB:

            Originally, I wanted to have blue LEDs on the bottom row, red LEDs on the middle row, and green LEDs on the top row.
            When I was soldering, all the blue LEDs worked fine, but I quickly found out that the red LEDs weren't turning on as red.
            They were turning on as white. I checked the red LED specifications and found that 
            red LEDs have a lower voltage drop than the others. I didn't account for that in my schematic design and attempted to color the LEDs with a 
            red expo marker, but it didn't work very well.
            <br><br>
            After soldering the LEDs on, I soldered the resistors on and soldered the battery cases and switch onto the board. When everything was done, 
            the PCB could now be used.
            <br><br>
            Here is the finished PCB:

            Now, I have a PCB that's portable and that lights up whenever I switch it on. I wanted to make this to have as a wall decoration in my living room.
